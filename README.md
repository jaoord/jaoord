# 🧠 @jaoord here

I write code. Sometimes it’s good. Sometimes it just works. Either way, it gets built.

### 🧪 Currently messing with:
- React + TypeScript
- .NET 8 (Razor Pages, minimal APIs)
- Supabase
- PayloadCMS
- Fake backends, real curiosity

### 🛠 Projects are mostly:
- Things I want to use myself
- Quick MVPs to test ideas
- A good excuse to avoid watching TV and the void

### 💬 I don’t do:
- 10x dev energy
- Clean architecture debates
- Framework tribalism
- Conferences where people clap at GraphQL slides like it's a magic trick

### 🕳️ Philosophical outlook
If it works and doesn’t wake me up at night, it’s probably fine.
